This project develops a predictive model using linear regression to estimate the MSRP of cars based on their features. The data we use comes from Kaggle. 
It describes almost 12000 car models sold in the United States between 1990 and 2018, including some features and market prices.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Explore Cars data and fit a regression line to the data.
Define Questions
Example questions will be given
Students can develop own questions
Identify Data Sources
csv files given in course material
Retrieve Data
Read the car data into a DataFrame
Data Wrangling, Exploration and Cleaning
Clean data and account for data inconsistencies, missing and duplicate data
Split data into train and test dataset
Analyze Data
Summarize the main characteristics of the data, using exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Calculate correlation between dependent and independent variables
Build a base model that can predict the MSRP of the cars
Enhance the performance of the model by utilizing feature engineering techniques
Cluster cars based on their price and fuel consumption attributes
Present Data to Stakeholders
Gather plots and metrics to make a story
